## Twilio & Last.fm API

This was a challenge set by [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/) when [Michael Wawra](wawra@twilio.com) visited [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). The goal was to create an app that incorporates Twilio's technology within half a day.

We created a web app that uses Twilio &amp; last.fm's APIs to send text messages on information regarding BBC Radio One's last played song.

Users can request for this information through a text message ('players') to Twilio, following which, the information on BBC Radio One's last played song and artist will be sent to the user via text message. 


##Instructions
1. Add your twilio account to the code
2. text the word 'player' to your twilio number!
(make sure your messaging request URL is pointing to the correct server URL)
